# Airbnb Analysis Project Report

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, Python scripting, Streamlit for web application development, and visualization tools like PowerBI or Tableau. The project aims to derive insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends in the Travel Industry, Property Management, and Tourism domain.

## Project Objectives

1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:**
   - Established a connection to MongoDB Atlas and efficiently retrieved the Airbnb dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Addressed missing values, duplicates, and performed necessary data type conversions for accurate analysis.

3. **Geospatial Visualization:**
   - Developed a Streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Explored variations in pricing based on location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.

5. **Availability Analysis by Season:**
   - Analyzed availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.

6. **Location-Based Insights:**
   - Investigated location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.

7. **Interactive Visualizations:**
   - Created dynamic and interactive visualizations enabling users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences.

8. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Built a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, combining various visualizations to present key insights.

## Data Handling and MongoDB Atlas

- **MongoDB Atlas Account:**
  - Created a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cluster for hosting the data.

- **Sample Data Loading:**
  - Loaded the Airbnb sample data into MongoDB Atlas, including collections for listings, reviews, and users.
