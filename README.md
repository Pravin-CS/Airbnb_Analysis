Airbnb Analysis Project Report
Project Overview
The Airbnb Analysis project is a comprehensive exploration of Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, Python scripting, data preprocessing, visualization techniques, and interactive tools such as Streamlit, Tableau, or Power BI. The project delves into the travel industry, property management, and tourism domain to extract valuable insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

Objectives
MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:

Successfully established a connection to MongoDB Atlas, retrieving the Airbnb dataset efficiently for analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and performed necessary data type conversions to ensure accurate analysis.
Streamlit Web Application:

Developed an interactive Streamlit web application showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings with maps, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.
Price Analysis and Visualization:

Conducted in-depth price analysis, exploring variations based on location, property type, and seasons. Created dynamic plots and charts to visualize trends and correlations.
Availability Analysis by Season:

Analyzed availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations using suitable visualizations such as line charts and heatmaps.
Location-Based Insights:

Investigated location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods. Utilized MongoDB queries and aggregation techniques.
Interactive Visualizations:

Created interactive visualizations that enable users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences. Users can explore specific regions, property types, or time periods of interest.
Dashboard Creation:

Built a comprehensive dashboard using either Tableau or Power BI, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
